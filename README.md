# Methods of Synthetic Data Generation for Combinatorial Problems with Large Language Models

This repository contains the code and data used for a research experiment evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in processing and generating mathematical texts. The research introduces new problem variations and a metric that captures the performance rate and correlation between baseline problems and generated variations.

The dataset is available in `JSON` and in `Parquet` formats on the [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/andynik/comb-gen-24) repository in two sizes:
- 1,000 problems (4,000 problems with variations)
- 5,583 problems (22,332 problems with variations)

## Project Stages

- **Stage 1: Data Filtering**
  - Filter subset of compbinatorial problems from the [NuminaMath-COT](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AI-MO/NuminaMath-COT).
  - Utilise LLM and regex formulas for answer extraction.

- **Stage 2: Variation Generation**
  - Use LLM to generate three new variations of the original problems: *fictional*, *adversarial* and *contextual disguise*.
  - Generate solutions for each variation, including *original*
  - Utilise LLM and regex formulas for answer extraction.

- **Stage 3: Analysis**
  - Run permutation tests and correlation tests.
  - Prepare plots about solution rates and correlation heatmap across variations.
  - Apply _F1 Variations Consistency Score_ to assess the quality of the generated data.

### Models Used in the Experiment

The open-source models tested during experimentation have been quantized using K-means quantization with the help of the [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) library.
