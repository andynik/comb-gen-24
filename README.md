# Methods of Synthetic Data Generation for Combinatorial Problems with Large Language Models

This repository contains the code and data used for a research experiment evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in processing and generating mathematical texts. The research introduces new problem variations and a metric that captures the performance rate and correlation between baseline problems and generated variations.

**Note:** The filtered dataset and code will be released upon paper approval.

## Project Stages

- **Stage 1: Filtering**
  - Filter 1,000 problems from [NuminaMath-COT](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AI-MO/NuminaMath-COT).

- **Stage 2: Answer Extraction**
  - Apply LLM along with regex functions for answer extraction.

- **Stage 3: Variation Generation**
  - Use LLM to generate three new variations of the original problems: *fictional*, *adversarial*, and *contextual disguise*.

- **Stage 4: Results Comparison**
  - Run permutation tests and correlation tests to assess the quality of the generated data and LLM performance.

## Models Used in the Experiment

The open-source models tested during experimentation have been quantized using K-means quantization with the help of the [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) library.
